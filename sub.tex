\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Definition}
We are working on a software development project based on a real business requirement from our customer. Our customer operates a retail laptop shop where most daily operations are still handled manually. In recent years, the shop has depended heavily on spreadsheets, handwritten invoices, and personal communication between sales staff and the manager. This approach has led to several recurring problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inventory Mismanagement:} Product quantities are updated manually, leading to frequent discrepancies between recorded and actual stock levels. As a result, the shop sometimes accepts orders for out-of-stock items or fails to restock high-demand models in time.
    \item \textbf{Slow Order Processing:} Staff must manually check prices, confirm stock availability, and record sales data. During peak hours, this creates long wait times, pricing errors, and decreased customer satisfaction.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Data Visibility:} The absence of a centralized system prevents the manager from tracking sales performance, identifying best-selling models, or generating analytical reports for data-driven decision-making.
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Refund and Warranty Handling:} Refund and exchange requests are tracked through paper notes or chat messages, causing missing records and inconsistent follow-up.
    \item \textbf{Limited Online Presence:} The store mainly serves walk-in customers and promotes products via social media, without an integrated online catalog or order management platform to reach a broader audience.
\end{itemize}

These issues have collectively reduced operational efficiency, caused customer dissatisfaction, and limited the store’s ability to scale in an increasingly competitive retail environment.

\subsection{Problem Solving}

To address these issues, the customer has commissioned our development team to design and implement a \textbf{web-based Laptop Store Management System}---a centralized digital platform that streamlines every core aspect of store operations.

Although the customer considered alternative solutions such as Excel-based management, commercial POS software, and third-party e-commerce platforms (e.g., Sapo, Haravan, or Shopify), these options were found unsuitable for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Limited Customization:} Off-the-shelf systems are generic and lack support for laptop-specific features such as hardware specification filters (CPU, RAM, storage) or model variants.
    \item \textbf{High Cost:} Commercial POS and ERP software typically charge recurring subscription fees, which are costly for small local retailers and often include unnecessary enterprise features.
    \item \textbf{Poor Integration:} Many systems separate offline and online sales channels, leading to unsynchronized inventory and inconsistent data between platforms.
    \item \textbf{Localization Limitations:} Foreign-built platforms lack complete Vietnamese language support and do not fully integrate with local payment services like VNPay or MoMo.
\end{itemize}

By hiring our team, the customer gains a \textbf{customized, cost-effective, and locally optimized solution} built to fit their business workflow. The proposed web application provides:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time \textbf{inventory management} with automatic low-stock alerts.
    \item Streamlined \textbf{order processing and payment} via both e-banking and cash-on-delivery.
    \item A \textbf{customer-facing portal} with search, filtering, and review features.
    \item A \textbf{refund and warranty ticket system} for efficient after-sales service.
    \item A management \textbf{dashboard} with visual analytics and performance reports.
\end{itemize}

Ultimately, this project aims to transform the shop from manual, paper-based processes into a modern, data-driven retail operation. The system enhances accuracy, efficiency, and customer satisfaction while providing a scalable technological foundation for future online growth.

\section{Planning}

\subsection{Motivation}

The Vietnamese laptop retail market has experienced substantial growth in recent years, driven by increasing demand from students, professionals, and businesses seeking portable computing solutions. According to market research, Vietnam's personal computer market, including laptops, has shown consistent year-over-year growth, with urban centers like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City leading consumption. This growth is accompanied by heightened competition among retailers, making operational efficiency and customer satisfaction critical differentiators.

Traditional laptop retail operations in Vietnam often rely on manual processes and fragmented systems. Small to medium-sized retailers frequently manage inventory through spreadsheets, process orders using paper-based methods, and maintain customer records without centralized databases. These practices lead to several operational challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inventory Mismanagement}: Without real-time tracking, retailers struggle to maintain optimal stock levels, resulting in lost sales opportunities or excess capital tied up in unsold inventory.
    
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Sales Operations}: Manual order processing increases transaction time, creates bottlenecks during peak periods, and introduces errors in pricing and order fulfillment.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Customer Insights}: The absence of customer data analytics prevents retailers from understanding purchasing patterns, preferences, and opportunities for targeted marketing.
    
    \item \textbf{Poor After-Sales Support}: Manual handling of refund requests and customer complaints leads to delays, inconsistent service quality, and reduced customer loyalty.
    
    \item \textbf{Scalability Constraints}: As businesses grow, manual systems become increasingly unsustainable, limiting the retailer's ability to expand operations or open new locations.
\end{itemize}

The development of the \textbf{Laptop Shop Management Web Application} is driven by the need to address these challenges through digital transformation. By implementing this comprehensive web-based system, Vietnamese laptop retailers can automate routine tasks, gain real-time visibility into operations, and deliver a superior customer experience, providing a powerful tool to increase profitability, strengthen customer loyalty, and secure a significant competitive advantage in the market.

\subsection{Initial System Request}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Development Costs}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Labor}: As an academic project, student labor is effectively free, though the opportunity cost of team members' time should be acknowledged. In a commercial context, developing a similar system would require approximately 800-1,000 person-hours of development effort.
        \item \textbf{Tools and Software}: All core technologies (React, Python, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, Firebase) are open-source or offer free tiers sufficient for development. Estimated cost: 0 VND for development phase.
        \item \textbf{Infrastructure}: Development can occur on existing computers. Cloud development environments or temporary testing servers may cost approximately 500,000-1,000,000 VND for the duration of the project if paid services are used.
        \item \textbf{Learning Resources}: Online documentation, tutorials, and courses are freely available. No significant costs for training materials.
        \item \textbf{Total Estimated Development Cost}: Approximately 1,000,000 VND for infrastructure (if needed), with most costs being opportunity costs of student time.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Deployment and Operational Costs}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Hosting}: A small laptop shop can deploy the application on budget cloud hosting for approximately 500,000-1,500,000 VND per month, depending on traffic levels. Providers like BKHOST or international services like Heroku or Railway offer suitable options.
        \item \textbf{Domain Name}: Approximately 200,000-500,000 VND per year for a .vn domain.
        \item \textbf{SSL Certificate}: Free options (Let's Encrypt) or paid certificates for 500,000-1,000,000 VND per year.
        \item \textbf{Payment Gateway Fees}: Vietnamese payment services (VNPay, MoMo) typically charge 1.5-3\% per transaction. For a shop processing 50,000,000 VND in online sales monthly, this equals 750,000-1,500,000 VND per month.
        \item \textbf{Maintenance and Updates}: Assuming quarterly updates and ongoing monitoring, approximately 2,000,000-3,000,000 VND per year in contractor time or in-house staff effort.
        \item \textbf{Total Estimated Annual Operational Cost}: Approximately 12,000,000-24,000,000 VND per year (hosting + domain + SSL + maintenance), plus 1.5-3\% of transaction values for payment processing.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Expected Financial Benefits}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Labor Savings}: Automating inventory and order management can save 2-3 hours of staff time per day. At an average retail staff wage of 5,000,000-7,000,000 VND per month, this represents monthly savings of approximately 1,500,000-2,000,000 VND.
        \item \textbf{Error Reduction}: Reducing pricing errors, order mistakes, and inventory discrepancies can prevent losses. Conservatively, preventing 2-3 errors per month saves approximately 500,000-1,000,000 VND monthly.
        \item \textbf{Increased Sales}: Improved customer experience and online presence can increase sales by 10-15\%. For a shop with 200,000,000 VND monthly revenue and 15\% profit margin, a 10\% sales increase generates an additional 3,000,000 VND monthly profit.
        \item \textbf{Inventory Optimization}: Better stock management can improve inventory turnover by 10-20\%, freeing up working capital. For a shop with 100,000,000 VND in average inventory, a 15\% reduction frees up 15,000,000 VND in capital.
        \item \textbf{Customer Retention}: Improved service quality and convenience can increase repeat purchase rates. Even a modest 5\% increase in customer retention can yield 1,000,000-2,000,000 VND additional monthly revenue for established shops.
        \item \textbf{Total Estimated Annual Benefits}: Approximately 60,000,000-84,000,000 VND per year in direct savings and increased profit (labor savings + error reduction + increased sales + retention), plus improved capital efficiency.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Return on Investment (ROI)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First-year net benefit: 60,000,000-84,000,000 VND (benefits) - 12,000,000-24,000,000 VND (operational costs) - 1,000,000 VND (deployment) = approximately 35,000,000-71,000,000 VND.
        \item ROI: (35,000,000-71,000,000 VND benefit) / (13,000,000-25,000,000 VND total cost) × 100\% = approximately 140-280\% in the first year.
        \item Payback period: Approximately 2-4 months based on monthly net benefits of 4,000,000-6,000,000 VND.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Break-Even Analysis}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Monthly break-even point: The shop needs to achieve approximately 1,500,000-2,500,000 VND in monthly benefits to cover operational costs.
        \item Given labor savings alone meet this threshold, the system is economically viable even without sales increases.
        \item Most shops will exceed break-even within the first month of operation.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Risk Considerations}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Adoption Risk}: If users do not fully utilize the system, benefits may be lower than projected. Mitigation: thorough training and user-friendly design.
        \item \textbf{Technical Issues}: System downtime could temporarily reduce sales. Mitigation: reliable hosting, backups, and offline contingency procedures.
        \item \textbf{Competition}: If competitors adopt similar systems, the competitive advantage diminishes. However, operational efficiency benefits remain.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion}: The project is economically feasible. With minimal development costs (academic context) and manageable operational expenses, the system offers strong ROI of 140-280\% in the first year and payback within 2-4 months. Benefits substantially exceed costs even under conservative assumptions. For Vietnamese laptop retailers, the investment represents a cost-effective path to operational improvement and competitive positioning.

\subsubsection{Legal \& Regulatory Feasibility}

Legal and regulatory feasibility examines whether the proposed system complies with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards in Vietnam. Key considerations include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Protection and Privacy}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Personal Data Protection}: Vietnam's legal framework for data protection is evolving. The 2018 Law on Cybersecurity and various government decrees impose requirements for collecting, processing, and storing personal data. The system must:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Obtain user consent for data collection and clearly communicate privacy policies.
            \item Implement security measures to protect customer personal information (names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses).
            \item Limit data collection to what is necessary for business purposes.
            \item Provide mechanisms for users to access, correct, or delete their personal data.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data Localization}: The Law on Cybersecurity requires certain types of data to be stored within Vietnam. While its application to small retail systems is not strictly enforced, using Vietnamese hosting providers or ensuring data storage options within Vietnam provides additional compliance assurance.
        \item \textbf{Firebase Compliance}: Firebase (Google) provides data processing agreements and complies with international data protection standards. However, retailers should be aware of data residency implications and configure Firebase regions appropriately if possible.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{E-Commerce Regulations}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Decree 52/2013/ND-CP}: Regulates e-commerce activities in Vietnam, requiring online retailers to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Display business registration information prominently on the website.
            \item Provide clear terms of service, delivery policies, and return/refund policies.
            \item Issue proper invoices for transactions in accordance with tax regulations.
            \item Maintain transaction records for specified periods.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The system must support displaying required business information and provide capabilities for storing transaction records and generating compliant invoices.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Consumer Protection}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Law on Protection of Consumer Rights}: Mandates clear product information, honest advertising, and fair warranty/return policies. The system must:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Display accurate product specifications and pricing.
            \item Support transparent refund/return processes as implemented through the refund ticket system.
            \item Provide clear terms and conditions accessible to customers.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Product Warranty Management}: While not directly implemented in the current system scope, retailers must comply with warranty obligations. The system should allow for recording warranty information for future enhancement.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Payment Regulations}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Electronic Payment}: The State Bank of Vietnam regulates electronic payment services. The system integrates with licensed payment service providers (VNPay, MoMo), which are responsible for payment processing compliance.
        \item \textbf{Cash Transactions}: Supporting cash-on-delivery complies with traditional payment preferences and avoids forcing customers into electronic payments if they prefer cash.
        \item \textbf{Tax Compliance}: The system must facilitate proper tax reporting by recording all transactions and allowing export of sales data for tax purposes.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Intellectual Property}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Software Licensing}: All technologies used (React, Python, PostgreSQL, etc.) are open-source with permissive licenses (MIT, Apache, BSD, PostgreSQL License) that allow commercial use without licensing fees. Proper attribution and compliance with license terms must be maintained.
        \item \textbf{Content Rights}: Product images and descriptions must either be original, licensed, or used with permission from manufacturers. The system design allows retailers to upload their own content, placing responsibility on them to ensure proper rights.
        \item \textbf{Trademark Compliance}: Product listings will reference laptop brand names (Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc.). This falls under nominative fair use when selling genuine products, but retailers must ensure they are authorized resellers if brand policies require it.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Accessibility and Standards}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item While Vietnam does not yet mandate web accessibility standards like some other countries, designing for accessibility is best practice and may become required in the future. The system should aim for reasonable accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility) where feasible.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Cybersecurity Requirements}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Law on Cybersecurity mandates protection of information systems and networks. The system must implement appropriate security measures:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Secure authentication (provided by Firebase).
            \item Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/SSL).
            \item Protection against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
            \item Regular security updates and patches.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Liability and Terms of Service}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system must include clear terms of service and disclaimers limiting liability for factors outside the retailer's control (e.g., manufacturer defects, shipping delays by third parties).
        \item Terms should be drafted in Vietnamese and comply with Vietnamese contract law principles.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion}: The project is legally and regulatory feasible with appropriate safeguards. Key compliance requirements include data protection measures, display of required business information, support for consumer protection practices, integration with licensed payment providers, and proper security implementation. No legal barriers prevent system development or deployment, though retailers must ensure their own business practices (business registration, tax compliance, authorized reseller status) are in order. Designing the system with compliance features (privacy policies, data security, transaction records) from the outset simplifies legal adherence and reduces future risks.

    \item The system shall follow modular design principles (MVC architecture) to simplify maintenance and future enhancements.
    \item Source code shall be well-documented and follow consistent coding standards.
    \item The system shall allow new features (e.g., loyalty programs, recommendation engines) to be added with minimal impact on existing components.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Compatibility}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall support modern web browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
    \item No client-side installation shall be required; the system shall be fully accessible via standard web browsers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Legal and Regulatory Compliance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall comply with Vietnamese regulations related to e-commerce, consumer protection, and personal data privacy.
    \item Customer personal data shall be collected only for legitimate business purposes and stored securely.

    \item Deployment shall be feasible on low-cost cloud hosting platforms.
    \item The system shall be usable without continuous technical supervision after deployment.
\end{itemize}


\section{Design}

% =====================================================
\subsection{Architecture Design}
% =====================================================

\subsubsection{Package Diagram}
The Laptop Store Management System is architected using the \textbf{Model--View--Controller (MVC)} design pattern, which ensures a clear separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability. This architecture divides the application into three interconnected components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Layer}: This layer represents the core business logic and data state of the application. It encapsulates entities specific to the domain, such as \texttt{Laptop} (product details, stock), \texttt{User} (customer and admin profiles), \texttt{Order} (transaction history), and \texttt{Cart} (temporary shopping items). The Model is responsible for data integrity and business rules, independent of the user interface.
    
    \item \textbf{View Layer}: The View layer is responsible for the presentation of data to the user. In our system, this includes the graphical user interfaces (GUI) such as the \textit{Product Catalog} for browsing laptops, the \textit{Shopping Cart} screen, the \textit{Checkout} interface, and the \textit{Admin Dashboard} for inventory management. The View observes the Model and updates the display when the state changes.
    
    \item \textbf{Controller Layer}: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model. It handles user interactions, such as adding a laptop to the cart or processing a payment. Controllers like \texttt{LaptopController} and \texttt{OrderController} receive input from the View, validate it, and invoke the appropriate business logic in the Model.
\end{itemize}

The dependency direction is strictly \textbf{View $\rightarrow$ Controller $\rightarrow$ Model}, ensuring that the business logic remains decoupled from the user interface. This structure allows for easier testing and future enhancements, such as adding new payment methods or modifying the UI without affecting the core system logic.

% =====================================================
\subsubsection{Detailed Package Diagram}
% =====================================================
This section presents the detailed package-level class organization following the MVC (Model--View--Controller) architecture.
Each package diagram groups classes by responsibility and highlights the main dependencies across layers.

% ------------------- Model Package -------------------
\paragraph{Model Package}
The \textbf{Model} package contains the system's core domain entities and state objects, representing business data such as users, laptops, carts, orders, payments, refunds, reviews, and filtering/metrics DTOs.
These classes encapsulate business rules (e.g., stock validation, subtotal computation, status transitions) and provide the data structures consumed by the Controller layer.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Package_Diagram/ModelPackage_redrawn.drawio.png}
    \caption{Detailed Package Diagram -- Model Package}
    \label{fig:model_package_diagram}
\end{figure}

% ------------------- View Package -------------------
\paragraph{View Package}
The \textbf{View} package defines all UI screens/components used by customers and administrators.
Views maintain UI state (inputs, selected IDs, current page, displayed lists) and expose event-driven methods (e.g., submit form, click actions) that forward user intents to controllers.
Views do not directly modify persistent data; instead, they render controller-provided Models (e.g., \texttt{M\_Laptop}, \texttt{M\_Order}, \texttt{M\_RefundTicket}) and display errors consistently via the base view behavior.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Detailed Package Diagram -- View Package}
    \label{fig:view_package_diagram}
\end{figure}

% ------------------- Controller Package -------------------
\paragraph{Controller Package}
The \textbf{Controller} package coordinates system workflows and mediates between Views and Models.
Controllers validate input, enforce business rules, orchestrate multi-step operations (checkout, payment confirmation, refund resolution), and return model snapshots for rendering.
This package also contains the payment gateway abstraction to isolate external payment integration from UI logic and domain objects.

\subsection{Data Storage Design}

\subsubsection{Overview}
The database design for the Laptop Shop Management System is structured to support the system’s core retail functionalities while maintaining data integrity and scalability. The system utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary relational database management system for structured transaction and user data.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{ERD_DB.png}
    \caption{Entity-Relationship diagram of the Laptop Management Store database}
    \label{fig:backend_architecture}
\end{figure}

The schema is centered around a normalized relational structure where the users table serves as the primary entity for identity management. Relationships are strictly enforced through foreign keys to ensure consistency across the product catalog (laptops), sales transactions (orders), and customer feedback (reviews). This design ensures that all user actions are traceable and that product inventory is accurately managed through dedicated line items.

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|p{8cm}|}

\textbf{Index} & \textbf{Table Name} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline

\section{Implementation}

The complete source code for the Laptop Store Management System is available on GitHub at the following repository:

\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/auphong2707/pttkht-laptopshop-management-web-application}
\end{center}

The repository contains the full implementation of both the frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) components, along with database schemas, Docker configuration files.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\subsection{Conclusion}
This report presented the analysis and design of the \textbf{Laptop Store Management System}, an online retail system supporting both customer-facing and administrative operations. The system was developed based on identified business needs and feasibility analysis, ensuring that the proposed solution is practical, scalable, and aligned with real-world e-commerce requirements.

The analysis phase employed standard system analysis techniques, including \textbf{use case diagrams, detailed use case specifications, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams}. These artifacts describe the complete interaction flow between users and the system. Customers are able to browse and filter laptops, manage shopping carts, place orders, make payments via multiple methods, track order status, submit product reviews, and request refunds. Administrators can manage inventory, monitor business metrics, update order statuses, and resolve refund tickets.

In the design phase, the system architecture was defined using the \textbf{Model--View--Controller (MVC)} pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns. The report provided detailed package diagrams and class specifications for the Model, View, and Controller layers. Core domain entities such as users, laptops, carts, orders, payments, reviews, and refund tickets were clearly defined. Additionally, a relational database schema was designed to maintain data integrity and support transactional consistency. Overall, this report provides a comprehensive blueprint for implementing a robust and maintainable laptop store management system.

\subsection{Future Work}
Although the current design satisfies the core functional and non-functional requirements, several enhancements can be considered to improve the system’s capabilities and long-term value.

First, system security can be strengthened by enforcing stricter authentication and authorization mechanisms, improving session management, and adding advanced protection against common web attacks. Logging and auditing features can also be expanded to support system monitoring and compliance requirements.

Second, the payment module can be extended to support additional payment gateways and improved transaction handling. Features such as webhook verification, retry mechanisms, and idempotent payment processing would increase reliability and reduce the risk of payment inconsistencies.

Third, order fulfillment functionality can be enhanced by integrating shipping carrier services, providing real-time delivery tracking, and automatically notifying customers of order status changes via email or SMS. These features would significantly improve customer experience and transparency.

In addition, refund processing can be improved by introducing configurable refund policies, time-based constraints, and richer communication between customers and administrators. Supporting attachments or evidence for refund requests would also improve dispute resolution.

From a business perspective, recommendation and personalization features such as related products, best-selling laptops, or personalized suggestions based on user behavior can be implemented to increase sales and customer engagement. The admin dashboard can also be expanded with more advanced analytics, including revenue trends, conversion rates, and refund statistics.

Finally, future development can focus on performance optimization and user experience improvements. This includes applying caching strategies, optimizing database queries, enhancing responsive design, and improving accessibility. Thanks to the modular MVC architecture, these enhancements can be implemented incrementally without major changes to the existing system structure.
