\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Definition}
% We are working on a software development project based on a real business requirement from our customer. Our customer operates a retail laptop shop where most daily operations are still handled manually. In recent years, the shop has depended heavily on spreadsheets, handwritten invoices, and personal communication between sales staff and the manager. This approach has led to several recurring problems:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Inventory Mismanagement:} Product quantities are updated manually, leading to frequent discrepancies between recorded and actual stock levels. As a result, the shop sometimes accepts orders for out-of-stock items or fails to restock high-demand models in time.
%     \item \textbf{Slow Order Processing:} Staff must manually check prices, confirm stock availability, and record sales data. During peak hours, this creates long wait times, pricing errors, and decreased customer satisfaction.
%     \item \textbf{Lack of Data Visibility:} The absence of a centralized system prevents the manager from tracking sales performance, identifying best-selling models, or generating analytical reports for data-driven decision-making.
%     \item \textbf{Inefficient Refund and Warranty Handling:} Refund and exchange requests are tracked through paper notes or chat messages, causing missing records and inconsistent follow-up.
%     \item \textbf{Limited Online Presence:} The store mainly serves walk-in customers and promotes products via social media, without an integrated online catalog or order management platform to reach a broader audience.
% \end{itemize}

% These issues have collectively reduced operational efficiency, caused customer dissatisfaction, and limited the store’s ability to scale in an increasingly competitive retail environment.

\subsection{Problem Solving}

% To address these issues, the customer has commissioned our development team to design and implement a \textbf{web-based Laptop Store Management System}---a centralized digital platform that streamlines every core aspect of store operations.

% Although the customer considered alternative solutions such as Excel-based management, commercial POS software, and third-party e-commerce platforms (e.g., Sapo, Haravan, or Shopify), these options were found unsuitable for several reasons:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Limited Customization:} Off-the-shelf systems are generic and lack support for laptop-specific features such as hardware specification filters (CPU, RAM, storage) or model variants.
%     \item \textbf{High Cost:} Commercial POS and ERP software typically charge recurring subscription fees, which are costly for small local retailers and often include unnecessary enterprise features.
%     \item \textbf{Poor Integration:} Many systems separate offline and online sales channels, leading to unsynchronized inventory and inconsistent data between platforms.
%     \item \textbf{Localization Limitations:} Foreign-built platforms lack complete Vietnamese language support and do not fully integrate with local payment services like VNPay or MoMo.
% \end{itemize}

% By hiring our team, the customer gains a \textbf{customized, cost-effective, and locally optimized solution} built to fit their business workflow. The proposed web application provides:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Real-time \textbf{inventory management} with automatic low-stock alerts.
%     \item Streamlined \textbf{order processing and payment} via both e-banking and cash-on-delivery.
%     \item A \textbf{customer-facing portal} with search, filtering, and review features.
%     \item A \textbf{refund and warranty ticket system} for efficient after-sales service.
%     \item A management \textbf{dashboard} with visual analytics and performance reports.
% \end{itemize}

% Ultimately, this project aims to transform the shop from manual, paper-based processes into a modern, data-driven retail operation. The system enhances accuracy, efficiency, and customer satisfaction while providing a scalable technological foundation for future online growth.

\section{Planning}

\subsection{Motivation}

% The Vietnamese laptop retail market has experienced substantial growth in recent years, driven by increasing demand from students, professionals, and businesses seeking portable computing solutions. According to market research, Vietnam's personal computer market, including laptops, has shown consistent year-over-year growth, with urban centers like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City leading consumption. This growth is accompanied by heightened competition among retailers, making operational efficiency and customer satisfaction critical differentiators.

% Traditional laptop retail operations in Vietnam often rely on manual processes and fragmented systems. Small to medium-sized retailers frequently manage inventory through spreadsheets, process orders using paper-based methods, and maintain customer records without centralized databases. These practices lead to several operational challenges:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Inventory Mismanagement}: Without real-time tracking, retailers struggle to maintain optimal stock levels, resulting in lost sales opportunities or excess capital tied up in unsold inventory.
    
%     \item \textbf{Inefficient Sales Operations}: Manual order processing increases transaction time, creates bottlenecks during peak periods, and introduces errors in pricing and order fulfillment.
    
%     \item \textbf{Limited Customer Insights}: The absence of customer data analytics prevents retailers from understanding purchasing patterns, preferences, and opportunities for targeted marketing.
    
%     \item \textbf{Poor After-Sales Support}: Manual handling of refund requests and customer complaints leads to delays, inconsistent service quality, and reduced customer loyalty.
    
%     \item \textbf{Scalability Constraints}: As businesses grow, manual systems become increasingly unsustainable, limiting the retailer's ability to expand operations or open new locations.
% \end{itemize}

% The development of the \textbf{Laptop Shop Management Web Application} is driven by the need to address these challenges through digital transformation. By implementing this comprehensive web-based system, Vietnamese laptop retailers can automate routine tasks, gain real-time visibility into operations, and deliver a superior customer experience, providing a powerful tool to increase profitability, strengthen customer loyalty, and secure a significant competitive advantage in the market.

While its application to small retail systems is not strictly enforced, using Vietnamese hosting providers or ensuring data storage options within Vietnam provides additional compliance assurance.
%         \item \textbf{Firebase Compliance}: Firebase (Google) provides data processing agreements and complies with international data protection standards. However, retailers should be aware of data residency implications and configure Firebase regions appropriately if possible.
%     \end{itemize}
    
%     \item \textbf{E-Commerce Regulations}:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{Decree 52/2013/ND-CP}: Regulates e-commerce activities in Vietnam, requiring online retailers to:
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item Display business registration information prominently on the website.
%             \item Provide clear terms of service, delivery policies, and return/refund policies.
%             \item Issue proper invoices for transactions in accordance with tax regulations.
%             \item Maintain transaction records for specified periods.
%         \end{itemize}
%         \item The system must support displaying required business information and provide capabilities for storing transaction records and generating compliant invoices.

%         \end{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{Product Warranty Management}: While not directly implemented in the current system scope, retailers must comply with warranty obligations. The system should allow for recording warranty information for future enhancement.
%     \end{itemize}
    
%     \item \textbf{Payment Regulations}:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{Electronic Payment}: The State Bank of Vietnam regulates electronic payment services. The system integrates with licensed payment service providers (VNPay, MoMo), which are responsible for payment processing compliance.
%         \item \textbf{Cash Transactions}: Supporting cash-on-delivery complies with traditional payment preferences and avoids forcing customers into electronic payments if they prefer cash.
%         \item \textbf{Tax Compliance}: The system must facilitate proper tax reporting by recording all transactions and allowing export of sales data for tax purposes.
%     \end{itemize}
    
%     \item \textbf{Intellectual Property}:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{Software Licensing}: All technologies used (React, Python, PostgreSQL, etc.) are open-source with permissive licenses (MIT, Apache, BSD, PostgreSQL License) that allow commercial use without licensing fees. Proper attribution and compliance with license terms must be maintained.
%         \item \textbf{Content Rights}: Product images and descriptions must either be original, licensed, or used with permission from manufacturers. The system design allows retailers to upload their own content, placing responsibility on them to ensure proper rights.
%         \item \textbf{Trademark Compliance}: Product listings will reference laptop brand names (Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc.). This falls under nominative fair use when selling genuine products, but retailers must ensure they are authorized resellers if brand policies require it.
%     \end{itemize}
    
%     \item \textbf{Accessibility and Standards}:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item While Vietnam does not yet mandate web accessibility standards like some other countries, designing for accessibility is best practice and may become required in the future. The system should aim for reasonable accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility) where feasible.
%     \end{itemize}
    
%     \item \textbf{Cybersecurity Requirements}:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The Law on Cybersecurity mandates protection of information systems and networks. The system must implement appropriate security measures:
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item Secure authentication (provided by Firebase).
%             \item Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/SSL).
%             \item Protection against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
%             \item Regular security updates and patches.
%         \end{itemize}
%     \end{itemize}
    
%     \item \textbf{Liability and Terms of Service}:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The system must include clear terms of service and disclaimers limiting liability for factors outside the retailer's control (e.g., manufacturer defects, shipping delays by third parties).
%         \item Terms should be drafted in Vietnamese and comply with Vietnamese contract law principles.
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% \textbf{Conclusion}: The project is legally and regulatory feasible with appropriate safeguards. Key compliance requirements include data protection measures, display of required business information, support for consumer protection practices, integration with licensed payment providers, and proper security implementation. No legal barriers prevent system development or deployment, though retailers must ensure their own business practices (business registration, tax compliance, authorized reseller status) are in order. Designing the system with compliance features (privacy policies, data security, transaction records) from the outset simplifies legal adherence and reduces future risks.

\subsection{Architecture Design}
% =====================================================

\subsubsection{Package Diagram}
The Laptop Store Management System is architected using the \textbf{Model--View--Controller (MVC)} design pattern, which ensures a clear separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability. This architecture divides the application into three interconnected components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Layer}: This layer represents the core business logic and data state of the application. It encapsulates entities specific to the domain, such as \texttt{Laptop} (product details, stock), \texttt{User} (customer and admin profiles), \texttt{Order} (transaction history), and \texttt{Cart} (temporary shopping items). The Model is responsible for data integrity and business rules, independent of the user interface.
    
    \item \textbf{View Layer}: The View layer is responsible for the presentation of data to the user. In our system, this includes the graphical user interfaces (GUI) such as the \textit{Product Catalog} for browsing laptops, the \textit{Shopping Cart} screen, the \textit{Checkout} interface, and the \textit{Admin Dashboard} for inventory management. The View observes the Model and updates the display when the state changes.
    
    \item \textbf{Controller Layer}: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model. It handles user interactions, such as adding a laptop to the cart or processing a payment. Controllers like \texttt{LaptopController} and \texttt{OrderController} receive input from the View, validate it, and invoke the appropriate business logic in the Model.
\end{itemize}

The dependency direction is strictly \textbf{View $\rightarrow$ Controller $\rightarrow$ Model}, ensuring that the business logic remains decoupled from the user interface. This structure allows for easier testing and future enhancements, such as adding new payment methods or modifying the UI without affecting the core system logic.

\subsection{Data Storage Design}

\subsubsection{Overview}
The database design for the Laptop Shop Management System is structured to support the system’s core retail functionalities while maintaining data integrity and scalability. The system utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary relational database management system for structured transaction and user data.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{ERD_DB.png}
    \caption{Entity-Relationship diagram of the Laptop Management Store database}
    \label{fig:backend_architecture}
\end{figure}

The schema is centered around a normalized relational structure where the users table serves as the primary entity for identity management. Relationships are strictly enforced through foreign keys to ensure consistency across the product catalog (laptops), sales transactions (orders), and customer feedback (reviews). This design ensures that all user actions are traceable and that product inventory is accurately managed through dedicated line items.
